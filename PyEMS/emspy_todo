- FIGURE OUT WHERE AGENT(act) -> ENV (state, reward) needs to happen (test)
- figure out best standard calling point(s)
- meta-elements for actuators, design actuator functionality (setting actuator values)
- how to automate using internal variables to scale actuator control (are names alike)?? (since everything is normalized [0,1]
- pandas dataframe with custom csv data logging
- RL simple wrapper
- how to deal/allow with multiple calling points (effects on zone timesteps and other callback dependencys)
- how to deal/allow multiple state instances and multiple API instances / simulations

???
- what calling point should be used for standard weather, vars, intvars, meters?

- RL: how will I know an agent is using predictive control strategies
