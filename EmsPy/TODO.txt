NEW:
CODE:
- figure out timestep total cnt
README:
- get rid of timestep warnings in README since handled

- figure out best standard calling point(s)
- RL simple wrapper
- how to deal/allow multiple state instances and multiple API instances / simulations

TODO
- take user input on timesteps and enforce it on build
- implement basic OpenStudio functionality for model manipulation (timestep enforcement, simulation span) ADD METHODS
- manage ems/time and zone timestep updates only ONCE per timestep (or if ems updates need to be more flexible allow
them to break up ems vars on calling point basis)
- how to automate actuator ranges and enforce compliance
- find all reference for documentation

???
- what calling point should be used for standard weather, vars, intvars, meters?
RL:
- RL: how will I know an agent is using predictive control strategies
